### **Why did I take this class?**
#### I took this class because I have an interest in programming and want to have a career in it. I have done coding and cyberpatriot before and it was an enjoyable experience. I want to learn about the basics of computer science so am looking forward to taking this class. 
 
  
   

### **What was the biggest issue I had?**
#### The biggest issue I had was when my ruby version wouldn't update. Even though I had downloaded the most recent version, 3.1.4, the ruby version would be stuck at 2.6.10. I was stuck on the issue for a whole day by asking my classmates and googling the issue. Finally, I decided to ask the teacher about it and found out that my computer was in bash because it was old. I changed it to the Z shell (zsh) by the command "chsh -s /bin/bash" and then typed "zsh". Ruby finally successfully updated to 3.1.4 and I moved onto the next step.
