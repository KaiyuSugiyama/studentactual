### Review Ticket Unit 0 / Week 2
## Tasks completed
I created a table ranking on the best soccer teams in the world. I also did the calculator hack and created a soccer quiz made out of python. 

## Challenges faced
My quiz wouldn't work for a day. Even though I hadn't changed anything when I loaded the site the next day, it worked.
