### Review Ticket Unit 1 / Week 6
## Tasks completed

- I read every single js tests from the dnhs website. 

- I completed DOM, JS, HTML, Data Types, and Errors hacks.

- I gave utterance comments to Eshaan Kumar and Drishya Mody on what they should work on and what they did well.

## Challenges faced

- I had trouble dragging the things from the teacher repository (it didn't work for some reason).

- Talk with my team on who did what for the live review.
