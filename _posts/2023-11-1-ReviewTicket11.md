### Review Ticket Unit 1 / Week 11
## Tasks completed
I deployed my backend through AWS and chose a port
I connected my data using an API model and put it into our frontend repository
Created new fifa players with stats

## Challenges faced
Sadly did not qualify for NATM but still wanted to fix the error with fetching the data in the frontend repository
I troubleshooted and fixed my fetch error
